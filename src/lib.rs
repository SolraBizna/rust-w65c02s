//! This crate is a cycle-accurate simulator for the WDC W65C02S, the most
//! advanced direct descendent of that catalyst of the home computer
//! revolution, the 6502.
//!
//! This crate accurately simulates all bus signals of the W65C02S except RDY,
//! SOB, and BE, which can all be simulated by outside code. It is written in
//! such a way that the unused bus logic usually gets optimized out.
//!
//! This crate does not depend on any other libraries, including the standard
//! library.
//!
//! The W65C02S instruction set includes the original NMOS 6502 instructions,
//! the additional instructions supported by all CMOS 6502s, the "Rockwell bit
//! extensions" (`BBRx`/`BBSx`/`RMBx`/`SMBx`), and the `WAI` and `STP`
//! instructions.
//!
//! The accuracy of this simulation has been tested on the [`65test` test
//! suite](https://github.com/SolraBizna/65test), which contains over 4500
//! tests. In every single test, the simulator's bus traffic is *exactly* the
//! same as the real hardware—even down to the timing of IRQ and NMI signals.
//! This means that this simulator is suitable for prototyping and simulation
//! of real systems using the W65C02S processor, including systems based on the
//! W65C134S MCU.
//!
//! To use it, you will need an instance of [`W65C02S`](struct.W65C02S.html)
//! and an implementation of [`System`](trait.System.html). `W65C02S` simulates
//! the CPU; `System` must simulate the hardware attached to the bus (memory,
//! IO devices, et cetera).
//!
//! ```rust
